A console window will open up and you will be asked whether you would like to load the pre-processed dataset. The pre-processed dataset is stored in save.txt in the same folder as the executable.  \r\nDataset\r\nThe dataset itself resides in .\\dataset\\ and follows a specific directory structure. Firstly, it contains 2 folders â€“ images and labels. Each of those contains a list of corresponding folders named S*** where *** is the number of the subject. Each subject (S***) folder contains folders containing image sequences or a label of a particular expression (e.g. \\dataset\\images\\S032\\005\\ S032_005_00000001.png through to ",
